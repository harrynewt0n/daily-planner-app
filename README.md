# Daily Planner Application
An online web application that allows the user to schedule their work day by creating and saving tasks to the planner.
## Description
In this project we were tasked with utilising the JQuery library to build a workday scheduling app. The application should allow the user to create and schedule tasks, as well as see the current time and date.
## Installation
The application requires no installation as it is a live webpage.
## Usage
To utilise this application you can visit the webpage by following this URL:

https://harrynewt0n.github.io/daily-planner-app/

This should open up at webpage that looks like this:

The current date should be displayed in the heading of the application. The current hour should be highlighted in red, future timeblocks will be highlighted green, and past timeblocks will be grey. 

Simply click on the hour you wish to schedule over, input a task, and press the save button. An alert should then confirm that your task has successfully been created. 

You can also inspect the page by right-clicking, and this will show what has been stored on the schedule, via local storage, within the console log.
